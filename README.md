You need to implement the javascript and css files into your code. Add this to your code.

Put both the css files in the head, boos.css comes after reset.css.

	<link href="reset.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
	<link href="boos.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
	
Put boos.js at the bottom of your body.
